provider "aws" {
  region = "eu-west-2"
}

locals {
  domain = "testing.magnetar.it"
}

resource "aws_route53_zone" "magnetarit" {
  name = local.domain
}

module "ses" {
  source      = "git::https://github.com/MagnetarIT/terraform-aws-ses.git?ref=tags/0.1.0"
  r53_zone_id = aws_route53_zone.magnetarit.zone_id

## Inputs

| Name | Description | Type | Default | Required |
|------|-------------|------|---------|:--------:|
| abort\_incomplete\_multipart\_upload\_days | Maximum time (in days) that you want to allow multipart uploads to remain in progress | `number` | `5` | no |
| acl | The canned ACL to apply. We recommend `private` to avoid exposing sensitive information | `string` | `"private"` | no |
| allow\_encrypted\_uploads\_only | Set to `true` to prevent uploads of unencrypted objects to S3 bucket | `bool` | `false` | no |
| attributes | Additional attributes (e.g. `1`) | `list(string)` | `[]` | no |
| enable\_glacier\_transition | Enables the transition to AWS Glacier which can cause unnecessary costs for huge amount of small files | `bool` | `false` | no |
| environment | Environment, e.g. 'prod', 'staging', 'dev', 'pre-prod', 'UAT' | `string` | n/a | yes |
| expiration\_days | Number of days after which to expunge the objects | `number` | `90` | no |
| force\_destroy | A boolean string that indicates all objects should be deleted from the bucket so that the bucket can be destroyed without error. These objects are not recoverable | `bool` | `false` | no |
| glacier\_transition\_days | Number of days after which to move the data to the glacier storage tier | `number` | `60` | no |
| kms\_master\_key\_arn | The AWS KMS master key ARN used for the `SSE-KMS` encryption. This can only be used when you set the value of `sse_algorithm` as `aws:kms`. The default aws/s3 AWS KMS master key is used if this element is absent while the `sse_algorithm` is `aws:kms` | `string` | `""` | no |
| lifecycle\_rule\_enabled | Enable or disable lifecycle rule | `bool` | `false` | no |
| lifecycle\_tags | Tags filter. Used to manage object lifecycle events | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| name | Solution name, e.g. 'app' or 'jenkins' | `string` | n/a | yes |
| namespace | Namespace, which could be your team, business name or abbreviation, e.g. 'mag' or 'tar' | `string` | n/a | yes |
| noncurrent\_version\_expiration\_days | Specifies when noncurrent object versions expire | `number` | `90` | no |
| noncurrent\_version\_transition\_days | Number of days to persist in the standard storage tier before moving to the glacier tier infrequent access tier | `number` | `30` | no |
| policy | A valid bucket policy JSON document. Note that if the policy document is not specific enough (but still valid), Terraform may view the policy as constantly changing in a terraform plan. In this case, please make sure you use the verbose/specific version of the policy | `string` | `""` | no |
| prefix | Prefix identifying one or more objects to which the rule applies | `string` | `""` | no |
| region | If specified, the AWS region this bucket should reside in. Otherwise, the region used by the callee | `string` | `""` | no |
| s3\_actions | Actions to allow in the policy, default is read only | `list(string)` | <pre>[<br>  "s3:GetObject"<br>]</pre> | no |
| sse\_algorithm | The server-side encryption algorithm to use. Valid values are `AES256` and `aws:kms` | `string` | `"AES256"` | no |
| standard\_transition\_days | Number of days to persist in the standard storage tier before moving to the infrequent access tier | `number` | `30` | no |
| tags | Additional tags (e.g. `map('BusinessUnit','XYZ')` | `map(string)` | `{}` | no |
| user\_enabled | Set to true to enable the module to create an IAM user | `bool` | `false` | no |
| user\_force\_destroy | Destroy even if it has non-Terraform-managed IAM access keys, login profiles or MFA devices | `bool` | `false` | no |
| user\_path | Path in which to create the user | `string` | `"/"` | no |
| versioning\_enabled | A state of versioning. Versioning is a means of keeping multiple variants of an object in the same bucket | `bool` | `false` | no |

---

## Outputs

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| access\_key\_id | The access key ID |
| bucket\_arn | Bucket ARN |
| bucket\_domain\_name | FQDN of bucket |
| bucket\_id | Bucket Name (aka ID) |
| secret\_access\_key | The secret access key. This will be written to the state file in plain-text |
| ses\_smtp\_password | The secret access key converted into an SES SMTP password by applying AWS's documented conversion algorithm. |
| user\_arn | The ARN assigned by AWS for this user |
| user\_enabled | Is user creation enabled |
| user\_name | Normalized IAM user name |
| user\_unique\_id | The unique ID assigned by AWS |
